    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <!-- this is a short writing about myself for my Altschool Assignment 1-->
    <p>
      My name is Muhammed Jamiu Omananyi and i am from Kogi State. <br />
      I studied Mass communication (B.Sc.) and graduated in 2019. <br />
      I have been so curious about what to do in life even after <br />
      working with two good companies in Lagos. I told myself Software
      Engineering was it. <br />
      Luckily one day i was just scrolling through twitter (X) and i came across
      <br />
      Sultan's post about altschool giving out scholarships to more than a
      hundred people <br />
      <a
        href="https://twitter.com/hackSultan/status/1666189827581042700?t=rFx62_4-fNj1B2NRiMdHFQ&s=19"
      >
        The Twitter (X) post.</a
      >
      Then i got in and paid the Application fee <br />
      That was how i got selected. Eyes on the goal and nothing else.
      <br />

      So, the more i go, the more i discover there is a whole lot to cover.
      Therefore i am utilizing this <br />
      rare opportunity to connect with good guys here on altschool Slack
      channel, Twitter (X) and even on my circle.
